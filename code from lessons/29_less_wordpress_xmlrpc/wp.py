# <p>Neil Alden Armstrong (August 5, 1930 â€“ August 25, 2012) was an American astronaut
# and aeronautical engineer and the first person to walk on the Moon. He was also a
# naval aviator, test pilot, and university professor.</p>
#
# <p>A graduate of Purdue University, Armstrong studied aeronautical
# engineering; his college tuition was paid for by the U.S. Navy under
# the Holloway Plan. He became a midshipman in 1949 and a naval aviator
# the following year. He saw action in the Korean War, flying the Grumman
# F9F Panther from the aircraft carrier USS Essex. In September 1951, while
# making a low bombing run, Armstrong's aircraft was damaged when it collided
# with an anti-aircraft cable which cut off a large portion of one wing.
# Armstrong was forced to bail out. After the war, he completed his bachelor's
# degree at Purdue and became a test pilot at the National Advisory Committee
# for Aeronautics (NACA) High-Speed Flight Station at Edwards Air Force Base in
# California. He was the project pilot on Century Series fighters and flew the
# North American X-15 seven times. He was also a participant in the U.S. Air
# Force's Man in Space Soonest and X-20 Dyna-Soar human spaceflight programs.</p>
#
# <p>Armstrong joined the NASA Astronaut Corps in the second group,
# which was selected in 1962. He made his first spaceflight as command
# pilot of Gemini 8 in March 1966, becoming NASA's first civilian
# astronaut to fly in space. During this mission with pilot David Scott,
# he performed the first docking of two spacecraft; the mission was
# aborted after Armstrong used some of his re-entry control fuel to
# stabilize a dangerous roll caused by a stuck thruster. During training
# for Armstrong's second and last spaceflight as commander of Apollo 11,
# he had to eject from the Lunar Landing Research Vehicle moments
# before a crash.</p>
